##So finally, after too many years of world class procrastination I finally have my first site!

And what a beauty she is. From start to finish this site has taken me about 4 days to complete. To say I'm pleased is an understatement, not only because it has taken me so long to get this far but also because I did it self motivated.

I'd like to send out a special thanks to [David Darnes](http://twitter.com/daviddarnes), for helping me not only with my snazzy logo but also solving a few of the irritating bugs webkit & friends threw my way.

###So who am I?
I'm Rob, a developer from Great Britain. I started coding in 2007 while studying at school with ASP.NET A lot of people love & hate it & personally I don't blame them. Looking back  there was a lot of good stuff in the .net framework if you knew what you were doing from the outset. I clearly didn't!

So one thing lead to another & I made the switch to PHP. Moving over was a breath of fresh air from the often complicated world of xml config files & code behind files. Initially I started using Kohana after being recommended by [Richard Standbrook](http://twitter.com/richstandbrook), but I also dabbled in WordPress after discovering its ability to get a basic site up in minutes.

It wasn't until working on the famed Jigoshop plugin that I discovered all the new things that WordPress could do such as custom post types, routing to name just a few. I also had good fun learning about working on a distributed product to boot!

###What's occuring
Like many in the industry I decided I should start writing some of my *lightbulb* moments down so:
1. I have a reference to check if I've forgotten anything
2. Hopefully I save someone else who's in the same boat some head scratching
3. So I can share some my ideas with the rest of the world
