##So finally, after too many years of world class procrastination I finally have my first site!

And what a beauty she is. From start to finish this site has taken me about 4 days to complete. To say I'm pleased is an understatement, not only because it has taken me so long to get this far but also because I did it self motivated.

I'd like to send out a special thanks to [David Darnes](http://david.darn.es), for helping me not only with my snazzy logo but also solving a few of the irritating bugs webkit & friends threw my way.

###So who am I?
I'm Rob, a developer from Great Britain. Like many in my industry I decided I should start writing some of my _aha_ moments down so one; I never forget them & two; hopefully save someone else some head scratching.

I started coding in 2007 while studying at school. My first experience was Learning how to make eCommerce websites in ASP.NET 2. Unfortunately for me, learning ASP.NET without any prior knowledge it was like learning to swim in strong currents. Regardless I had fun & I love what I do & a few months later I cofounded Orange Peel with @createdbypete.

After moving into some new offices we started experimenting with new languages and techniques. A really talented developer @richardstandbrook introduced me to the comparably simple world of PHP where I have lived ever since. Initially I developed using [kohana]() which introduced me to concepts like MVC, routing & ORM's.


###I met WordPress
My first encounter with WordPress was when I joined Jigowatt to work on the Jigoshop plugin. It wasn't until looking through Jigoshop that I realised just how powerful WordPress is, if you use it's API's to their full potential. It was fantastic & terrifying to experience the fast pace of open source development. Every day a new pull request comes, or a bug is filed which can be overwhelming at times.
